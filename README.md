# Classification methods applied to an imbalanced big dataset

Here you can find my first`Machine Learning project` in R:

## Description: 

This analysis is part of the final project of the subject `Machine Learning 1: classification methods` taught at the `University of Warsaw`. The final project consisted in two projects `regression` and `classification` made together with `Lashari Gochiashvili`. 

The purpose of this analysis is to apply `classification` methods to a big dataset, in order to classify the cars with a `symboling` security level: `secure`, `neutral` and `risky`.

In this analysis several methods will be applied, such as `learning vector quantization`, `multinomial regression`, `penalized multinomial regression`, `k-nearest neighbors`, `support bvector machine`, `linear discriminant analysis` and `quadratic discriminant analysis`. 

Aditionaly, several techniches will be applied in order to find the best model `performance`, among which we can find `down-sampling`, `cross-validation`, `tuning` our model by different parameters and `pre processing`.

All of these techniques are based on the `caret package`, one of the most known `R package` for `Machine Learning`
